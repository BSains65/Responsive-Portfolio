		<p class="pagetext">My name is Briant Sainsbury. I am 20 years old and have lived in Utah my entire life. I am from a family of five with two
			younger brothers. We live in Bountiful and haved lived in the same house my entire life. I enjoy the outdoors, sports,
			movies, among other things.My favorite movies are "The Lord of the Rings," and my favorite superhero is Iron Man. Hopefully,
			with the help of this class, I can start to try and be as smart as Tony Stark.</p>
		<p class="pagetext">In my spare time I enjoy hunting, fishing, playing basketball, golf, football,and soccer. I am a video games fanatic and
			am obsessed with the game "Fortnite" for the time being. I love being with family and enjoy just having a good time!</p>
